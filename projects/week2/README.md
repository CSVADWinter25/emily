## Project 2 Readme

for this assignemnt, i used the ellsworth kelly in class example, and modified it changing the dw and dh, as well as the shapes themselves on the grid. 

for instance the shapes are now charachters and are not randomized rather i divided them into two different arrays.
that's how we get a looping of the words "world" in the background and "hello" as the colorful text in the forefront. 

in addition, i added a randomization of the text size of the charachters in the world "hello"
